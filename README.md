- Preferably to be tested with a **_local server_**, like live server.
- The icons used are from the CDN of [Boxicons project.](https://boxicons.com/)
- I made this **without any other resources** beforehand, I couldn't find an ideal background image that fit the design, so I left the white.
- The layout for the mobile version is non-existent, so I had to improvise to make it **responsive**.
- Leave me a comment if you have tested it, **_rate me out of_** ðŸ”Ÿ ðŸ˜œ
